# Project Gutenberg scraper  

Forked from [gutenberg_scraper](https://www.katherinepully.com/project-gutenberg-scraper/)

This fork includes a tiny bash script to bulk download a list of book ids and store them in a separate directory. 
This means that only the `.txt` file needs to be modified to specify what books need to be downloaded.
